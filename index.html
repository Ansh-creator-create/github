    <h3>The jasalmand island resort,India</h3>
<p>Spanning across an area of about 100 sq.km., Jaisamand Lake is the second largest artificial lake in the country after Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar. It is surrounded by the Jaisamand Wildlife Sanctuary which is home to a variety of rare animals and migratory birds. The summer palaces of Queens of Udaipur also form a beautiful backdrop. Situated in seamlessly beautiful surroundings, it is a place to rejoice. On its marble dam, there are six cenotaphs and a temple dedicated to Shiva at the centre. The temple is proof that the people of Mewar were conscious of their worship rituals. Locals know it by the name of Dhebar Lake as well.

The lake was constructed by Maharaja Jai Singh in the 17th century, to be more precise in 1685, while he was building a dam across the Gomti river. The 'Ocean of Victory', as its name suggests, was inaugurated on June 2, 1691. It has three islands which are inhabited by the tribe of Bhil Minas. The two bigger islands are called Baba ka Magra and the small island is known as Piari. To its north, the lake has a palace with a courtyard and a pavilion of 12 pillars to its south. There is also a massive bund at the height of over 1200ft on the lake. The Jaisamand lake is clean, beautiful and a nature lover's real paradise. Away from the turmoil of the city, this place of utmost peace is a must visit.</p>

          <h3>The nargardh fort</h3>
          <p>Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defence ring for the city. The fort was originally named Sudarshangarh, but it became known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'. The popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh Bhomia, whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed construction of the fort. Nahar's spirit was pacified by building a temple in his memory within the fort, which thus became known by his name.Built mainly in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the king of Jaipur, the fort was constructed as a place of retreat on the summit of the ridge above the city. Walls extended over the surrounding hills, forming fortifications that connected this fort to Jaigarh, the fort above the old capital of Amber. Though the fort never came under attack during the course of its history, it did see some historical events, notably, the treaties with the Maratha forces who warred with Jaipur in the 18th century. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the Europeans of the region, including the British Resident's wife, were moved to Nahargarh fort by the king of Jaipur, Sawai Ram Singh, for their protection.

The fort was extended in 1868, during the reign of Sawai Ram Singh. In 1883-92, a range of palaces was built at Nahargarh by Dirgh Patel at a cost of nearly three and a half lakh rupees.[6] The Madhavendra Bhawan, built by Sawai Madho Singh had suites for the queens of Jaipur and at the head was a suite for the king himself. The rooms are linked by corridors and still have some delicate frescoes. Nahargarh was also a hunting residence of the Maharajas.</p>

The agreement for the Ken-Betwa Link Project heralds the inception of the inter-state cooperation to implement former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's vision to carry water from areas with a surplus to drought-prone and water-scarce areas through interlinking rivers, according to a statement from the Prime Minister's office

                2030 and a proportionally similar boost to conifer forests. The modeled scenario most resembling the current situation is based on the signature of UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement with the EU, and would lead to a 20% increase in broadleaf forest and 18% increase in coniferous forest, equivalent to around 85 million more trees.

The increase would be largely due to the reduction of land being used for sheep grazing, as well as increased activity in commercial forestry due to a proposed adoption of a form of Environmental Land Management payment scheme in place of the EU-wide Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
